# Robust set stabilization with a graphical method 


## How to run

0. Required Python version >= 3.10.
1. Change to the *rss* root directory in your terminal.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install .`

   Alternatively and better, if you use `rye` for package management, please install dependencies with `rye sync`.

3. Run the T-LGL example with `python ./examples/TLGL/TLGL.py`. And run the other examples similarly.
