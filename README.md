# Robust set stabilization with a graphical method 


## How to run

0. Required Python version >= 3.10.
1. Change to the *rss* root directory in your terminal.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install .`

   Alternatively, if you use [`rye`](https://rye-up.com/guide/) for package management, please install dependencies with `rye sync`.

3. Run the T-LGL example with `python ./examples/TLGL/TLGL.py`. And run the other examples similarly. For example, to reproduce the examples using a tiny network in the paper, type `python ./examples/tiny/tiny_network.py`.
Note that these must be executed when the terminal is in the *rss* root directory.
